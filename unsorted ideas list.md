On attribution and stealing ideas.
Inspired by all the poeple who steal ideas that I wont mention, and by people who
always give attribution even when they don't have to, like Walter, and poeple who
generate new meaning from the world around them like @fortyfoxes

All ideas are inspired by other ideas and by conversations. Sometimes mixing a few old ideas
gives it a new meaning. Sometimes people say that ideas worth nothing, and it is implementation that counts.
I believe vague ideas worth nothing, but if they come with a rough implementatiion plan they worth a lot.
They are like recipies of a good cocktail.
It think it is important to always reference people you had conversations with who inspired ideas and even a way of thinking
that led you to the original idea cocktail recipe. I think it is important to reference people who gave you ideas even
you were the one who did all the implementation. It's important not from some hippie fluffy being nice 
perspective, but a crucial thing that protects everyone from going stale.
Reputaional rent seeking behaviour kills true artists. Attribution is a type of non-monerary value that protects
the world from getting stale. Copyright is lame, because it doesn't cater for current information propagation,
but open source of ideas can only work if you publish your source code. Think of attribution to people 
who inspired your ideas as your source code. If you are trying to appropriate ideas because you implemented them and think
it is making your reputation better, well, perhaps you would be able to monetise it, but you will always remain a shitty artist uncapable of finding and communicating a new original meaning. Being open about the fact that ideas are not yours, and you were inspired by other poeple evenually leads you to get over this fact and become trully creative.
If you lie to yourself and to others cipying other's ideas and appropriating them, you will always stay on this level.
If there will be many people like that, eventualy everything they produce will become stale. 
In fact, I believe, even if you come up with an original idea yourself, and have a full right to attribute it to yourself,
mentionning poeple who inspired your thinking that led you to
